## Frontend Dev
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a frontend developer mainly working with the React stack, passionate about Next.js and its ecosystem.

I have carried out projects, like my own design of Ecommerce of Vans products and also an Online real estate agency.
For the development of the Ecommerce Vans, I used functional components, hooks, libraries like React Router and Material UI, and Firebase to store the user's final purchase.
For Online real estate agency, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript vanilla with the integration of design libraries such as Bootstrap and SASS.
I have also made small web app such as a To do List, calculator and a notes app, among others.

I invite you to visit my repositories so that you can see my work.
